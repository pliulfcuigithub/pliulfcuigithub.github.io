Plasma instabilities and turbulence in astrophysics
===========
Plasma kinetic instabilities can arise from a range of mechanisms, such as temperature gradients, velocity shears, pressure anisotropies, or gradients in the magnetic field, causing plasmas to depart from their equilibrium states. They are widely present in astrophysical environments, which also have attracted extensive attention in the community of labo­ratory astrophysics, where they have been extensively studied through experiments, theories, and numerical simulations using laser-­driven convective plasma systems. we focus on the derivation of the dispersion equations for the potential normal modes in a counter­streaming plasma system based on kinetic theory and rigorously solved them using numerical methods. Additionally, we also pay attention to the nonlinear evolution of unstable modes and particle dynamical behaviour.

Plasma turbulence in astrophysics hold great significance in field amplification and cosmic particle acceleration.

Laser-plasma high-quality particle sources
==========
With the improvement of laser intensity, the shortening of pulse duration and the progress of target fabrication technology in recent years, the studies on laser-driven ion acceleration are coming into our vision, and several new schemes for ion acceleration, such as break-out afterburner (BOA) and radiation pressure acceleration (RPA), have emerged. The scheme of RPA based on the interaction between ultraintense laser and ultrathin solid target has attracted a great deal of attention. However, the ultrathin foil employed in the RPA scheme is very susceptible to the transverse instabilities (such as Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability), which leads to deterioration of beam quality. It, therefore, becomes an urgent problem to be solved at present.
In my early research, we are focused on achieving stable long-range RPA and improving the beam quality of accelerated particles.
