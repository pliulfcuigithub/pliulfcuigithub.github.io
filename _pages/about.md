About me
======
I am a Tenure-track Assistant Professor at [Institute for Fusion Theory and Simulation](https://ifts.zju.edu.cn/iftsen/main.psp), [School of Physics](https://physics.zju.edu.cn/phy/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/).

Research interests
==
I study theoretical and computational plasma physics and specialize in gyrokinetic simulations of magnetic confinement fusion plasmas. I am generally interested in theoretical understanding of the simulation results, as well as in advanced numerical methods in application to gyrokinetic simulations.

Openings
======
Positions are available for postdocs and students.
