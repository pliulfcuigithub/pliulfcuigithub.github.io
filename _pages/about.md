About
======
Welcome to my research website, I am a Postdoc at [Institute of Theoretical Physics](http://www.itp.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences, I obtained my Ph.D. at Zhejiang University.

Research interests
=====

I primarily work in the cross-disciplinary domain of plasma astrophysics, integrating diverse areas of plasma physics, high-energy astrophysics, and high-energy density physics. I am engaged in the theories and numerical simulations of laser-plasma particle sources. Currently, my main research interests focus on plasma instabilities and turbulence associated with astrophysics. For a detailed description of my **research activities**, please follow this [link](https://pliulfcuigithub.github.io/research/).
